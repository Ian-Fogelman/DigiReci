# DigiReci

Inspired by the Kaggle challenge Digit Recognizer, I wanted to develop a front end web application that could be used to help train and analyze a models performance.

The challenge is given a matrix of 783 pixels, build a machine learning algorithm to identify the digit this is a classification and computer vision fundamentals type of problem.

This is the reason I designed Digit Reci, to provide a simple user interface to train test and analyze model performance.
